===============================================
SSL CERTIFICATE VALIDATION REQUIRED
===============================================

Primary Domain: ${domain_name}
Additional Domains: Root domain + wildcard subdomain

To complete SSL certificate validation, add the following DNS records to your DNS provider:

%{ for dvo in validation_options ~}
Domain: ${dvo.domain_name}
Record Type: CNAME
Name: ${dvo.resource_record_name}
Value: ${dvo.resource_record_value}

%{ endfor ~}

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Add ALL CNAME records above to your DNS provider (where your domain is hosted)
2. Each domain (primary + SANs) requires its own validation record
3. DNS propagation may take up to 48 hours, but usually completes within 15 minutes
4. The certificate will remain in "PENDING_VALIDATION" status until ALL DNS records are added
5. Once validated, the certificate will automatically be applied to CloudFront
6. Do NOT delete these DNS records - they are required for certificate renewal

After adding DNS records, you can check validation status with:
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <certificate-arn> --region us-east-1

CERTIFICATE COVERS:
- ${domain_name} (primary)
- Root domain and wildcard subdomain (SANs)
